<p>It&#8217;s pretty common for me to execute the same commands on a remote machine everyday. I usually do something like:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh &lt;machine.domain.com&gt;
screen -x   # reattach to irssi screen session</code></pre>

<p>The most obvious optimization to make is to edit the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to alias <code>machine.domain.com</code> to something easier to type, like just <code>machine</code>. Now I can just type:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh machine
screen -x   # reattach to irssi screen session</code></pre>

<p>Of course, it would be nice if I didn&#8217;t have to type <code>screen -x</code> each time as well. We can solve this by passing the commands to run on the remote maching as arguments to the ssh command. So we try:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh machine &#39;screen -x &#39;
Must be connected to a terminal.</code></pre>

<p>Uh oh. The remote machine is unable to start screen because, by default, a tty (a pseudoterminal), isn&#8217;t created when we execute remote commands. To work around this we need to pass the magic <code>-t</code> option. This forces the remote machine to create a tty for us.</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh machine -t &#39;screen -x &#39;</code></pre>

<p>Voila! Worked like a charm. And this is useful for a bunch of typical commands you&#8217;d like to run on a remote server, for example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ssh machine -t &#39;top&#39;  # grab stats

$ ssh machine -t &#39;watch ps -eaf | grep &lt;blah&gt;&#39;</code></pre>

<p>The final optimization we can make is to alias the whole command to something easy to type. Since I like to keep my aliases in a separate ~/.bash_aliases file, I run:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo alias irc=&#39;ssh machine -t &quot;screen -x&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_aliases</code></pre>

<p>Now, all I have to do is type <code>irc</code> everyday and I&#8217;m right back into my IRC session.</p>
